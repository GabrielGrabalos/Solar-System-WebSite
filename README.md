It may not seem like it, but I'm still currently working on this project. I'm finishing my Firestore configuration and soon will return to our usual commits.

For now, my TODOs are:

- Retrieving and showing the planets information;
- Adding more details related to the celestial bodies (rings, moons, texture, more celestial bodies present on our Solar System, etc.);
- Navigation tutorial;
- Settings tab for user experience;
- Better animation and navigation systems;
- Cleaner code.

  I really hope to see you following this journey with me! 🌠
